        <p>Our exploration and movie themed recipe creation continues with yet another summer blockbuster, Transformers: The Last Knight. Full disclosure here, we haven’t been as crazy about the past few Transformers movies. However, Transformers: The Last Knight feels very different. The fifth movie in the Transformer series appears to have made some changes including bringing Bumblebee more to the forefront of the film. This change is one of the inspirations for our Bumblebee’s Knees Cocktail.</p>
        <p>The Last Knight “shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero.  Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg); Bumblebee; an English Lord (Anthony Hopkins); and an Oxford Professor (Laura Haddock).”</p>
